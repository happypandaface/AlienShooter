All of this is my code, MINE, Scott Griffy.
I wrote it. Over the last 6 months, starting in December 2013.
Imuna finish it and put it on android and make a fart-ton of money.
And there's nothing you can do about it.
But if you wanna borrow the code go ahead, just ask me and show me what you're using from here before you release something commercially with my permission, which is the only way to release any of this code commercially.
